## Introduction

Welcome to the Corper's Lodge Football League Qualification Solution! This repository houses an R script designed to address the challenge of determining team qualification for the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and finals of a friendly football league. The solution focuses on the impartial evaluation of teams based on goals scored, goals conceded, and cards collected.

## Problem Statement

In the vibrant environment of a corper's lodge, the allure of friendly football matches is undeniable. However, a pressing question emerged: how could we establish a fair and consistent method to decide which teams would advance to the crucial knockout stages? With goals scored, goals conceded, and cards collected in the equation, a systematic approach was essential.

## Solution

The Corper's Lodge Football League Qualification Solution leverages the statistical power of R to introduce clarity and objectivity to the qualification process. The R script calculates a team's overall performance by attributing points to goals scored, goals conceded, and cards collected. This structured approach eliminates the ambiguity associated with team evaluations.

## Features

- Objective and transparent qualification process.
- Customizable point system for various criteria.
- Automated calculation of team scores.
- Sorting mechanism to determine qualified teams.

## Usage

1. Open the ![`qualification.R`](/qualification.R) file.
2. Adjust the point values for goals scored, goals conceded, yellow cards, and red cards according to your league's criteria.
3. Populate the list of teams with relevant data.
4. Run the script to generate the qualification results.
